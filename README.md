# Covid-19-Tracker

## This Project is a beginner friendly project I built using the JavaScript library Leaflet comsumming data from GeoServer and REST-API. Some key Aspects:

- Shows Live Cases, Recoveries, Deaths.

- Shows Worldwide cases and Country Based cases.

- Line Chart shows (cases, Deaths, Recovery) fluctuations over days, hover around to see exact figures.

- Clickable Markers on Map show Country stats and also display ( cases, deaths, recovery stats).

- Map with Different Controls ( fullscreen, zoom, Switch between BaseMaps, PDF printer in different formats)
